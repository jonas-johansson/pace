## Models

Switch models at any time with **Tab** or `/model <model-id>`. Model IDs use the full `provider/model` string. Models default to an unset variant, so Pace sends no explicit reasoning effort, thinking level, or similar provider-native options unless you select a variant. For models with variants, use **Ctrl+T** or `/variant <variant>` to cycle provider-native options such as OpenAI reasoning effort; the cycle includes the unset variant.

Pace ships with a curated built-in model catalog and also loads new models from [models.dev](https://models.dev) into the model picker. Built-in metadata and variants win for known models; fetched metadata adds models that Pace does not already know about.

| Built-in Model ID |
|---|
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6` |
| `anthropic/claude-opus-4-7` |
| `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` |
| `opencode/claude-haiku-4-5` |
| `opencode/claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `opencode/claude-opus-4-6` |
| `opencode/claude-opus-4-7` |
| `opencode/claude-opus-4-8` |
| `opencode/claude-fable-5` |
| `opencode/kimi-k2.6` |
| `opencode/kimi-k2.7-code` |
| `opencode/kimi-k3` |
| `opencode/deepseek-v4-pro` |
| `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash` |
| `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free` |
| `opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash` |
| `opencode/glm-5.2` |
| `opencode/glm-5.3` |
| `opencode/glm-5.3-flash` |
| `fireworks/glm-5.3` |
| `fireworks/glm-5.3-flash` |
| `fireworks/kimi-k2.6` |
| `fireworks/kimi-k2.7-code` |
| `friendli/glm-5.3-flash` |
| `opencode/gpt-5.5` |
| `openai/gpt-5.5` |
| `lmstudio/google/gemma-4-12b` |

Model catalog environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `PACE_MODELS_URL` | Override the models.dev source URL. Defaults to `https://models.dev`. |
| `PACE_MODELS_PATH` | Read/write a specific catalog JSON file instead of the default cache path. |
| `PACE_DISABLE_MODELS_FETCH` | Set to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to disable network refreshes. |

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| **Tab** / **Shift+Tab** | Cycle models forward / backward |
| **Ctrl+T** | Cycle the current model's variant, including unset |
| **Ctrl+G** | Toggle focused and detailed transcript views |
| **Escape** | Cancel the running prompt |
| **Ctrl+V** | Paste image from clipboard |
| **Ctrl+C** | Clear input, or press twice to exit |
| **Shift+Enter** | Insert a newline |
| **`!command`** | Run a shell command directly (e.g. `!ls -la`) |

## Slash commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation |
| `/model <model-id>[:variant]` | Switch model (or list models without args) |
| `/variant [variant|unset]` | Show, switch, or unset the current model's variant |
| `/sessions` | List saved sessions for this project |
| `/resume <id>` | Resume a saved session |
| `/undo` | Rewind to before the last user message |
| `/compact [focus]` | Summarize older context to free up the window |
| `/view <focused\|detailed>` | Switch between compact activity and the complete transcript |
| `/skills` | List available skills |
| `/skill:<name>` | Run a skill |
| `/agents` | List available subagents |
| `/mcp` | List connected MCP servers and tools |
| `/mcps` | Enable or disable MCP servers (Ctrl+E) |

Pace starts in focused view, which keeps every user message and each turn's final agent message — reasoning, tool output, and intermediate narration are hidden — plus a `Thinking...` line while Pace is working. The complete transcript is still recorded; press Ctrl+G or use `/view detailed` to reveal it at any time, including while Pace is working.

## File and image references

- **`@filename`** — mention a project file (autocomplete with Tab)
- **`@image(./path.png)`** — attach an image inline
- Bare image paths like `./screenshot.png` are also auto-detected

## Headless mode

`pace run` executes the agent non-interactively with the same wiring as the TUI (AGENTS.md, skills, MCP, subagents, sessions). The prompt comes from an argument, `--prompt`, `--prompt-file`, or piped stdin.

```sh
pace run "Summarize this repo"                     # plain text to stdout
pace run -p "fix the failing test" --model fireworks/glm-5.3:max
cat prompt.txt | pace run --output-format json
pace run --prompt-file task.md --output-format stream-json
pace run --session <id> "continue where we left off"
pace run --continue "what did we decide?"
```

Options:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-p, --prompt <text>` | Prompt text |
| `--prompt-file <path>` | Read the prompt from a file |
| `--session <id>` | Continue an existing session |
| `--continue` | Continue the most recent session for this project |
| `--model <id[:variant]>` | Model selection (falls back to config `defaultModel`) |
| `--output-format <f>` | `text` (default), `json` (final result object), or `stream-json` (NDJSON events) |
| `--max-turns <n>` | Cap assistant turns (exit code 2 when hit) |
| `--append-system <text\|@file>` | Append extra system text |
| `--steering-stdin` | Read NDJSON steering messages from stdin while running: `{"type":"steer","text":"..."}` |

`stream-json` emits one JSON object per line: `system` (session id, model), `text_delta`, `reasoning_delta`, `tool_start` / `tool_input` / `tool_output` / `tool_content` / `tool_end`, `usage` (per assistant turn), `compaction` (when the context is compacted), and a final `result` (text, turns, usage, cost, stop reason). Exit codes: `0` finished, `1` error, `2` turn cap, `130` cancelled.

Sessions created by `pace run` are normal Pace sessions: resume them in the TUI with `pace --session-id <id>`, or continue them headlessly with `--session <id>`.

## Context compaction

Long conversations are compacted automatically so the model never runs out of window. When the context reaches the threshold, Pace summarizes the older conversation with a one-shot LLM call (same model, system prompt, and tools, so cache-capable providers serve it mostly from cache), appends a `compaction` entry to the session tree, and continues from the summary plus the most recent ~20k tokens verbatim. Nothing is deleted: `/tree` still shows the full history, and expanding the compacted block in the TUI shows the summary.

Compaction also runs manually with `/compact [focus instructions]` — useful to shed context mid-task. Focus instructions are passed to the summarizer ("Pay particular attention to: …").

Configure it under the `compaction` key (all fields optional):

```json
{
  "compaction": {
    "auto": true,
    "thresholdTokens": 250000,
    "keepRecentTokens": 20000,
    "model": "opencode/deepseek-v4-flash:nothink"
  }
}
```

- `auto` — enable auto-compaction (default `true`)
- `thresholdTokens` — context size that triggers compaction, clamped to the model's window (default `250000`)
- `keepRecentTokens` — approximate size of the recent context kept verbatim (default `20000`)
- `model` — summarizer model override; defaults to the current model for cache sharing

## Configuration

Pace reads global configuration from `~/.config/pace/config.json`.

Pace also reads a global instructions file from `~/.config/pace/AGENTS.md` and merges it into the system prompt alongside the project `AGENTS.md` in the current working directory. Global instructions apply in every project; project-specific instructions take precedence. Create the file to set preferences that should always apply, such as:

```
Always talk in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English.
Always talk to me like I have ADHD.
```

Choose the startup model and the models that **Tab** / **Shift+Tab** cycle through with full `provider/model` IDs. Omit `:variant` for the unset/default selection, or use `provider/model:variant` to select a provider-native variant explicitly:

```json
{
  "defaultModel": "opencode/gpt-5.5:medium",
  "cycleModels": [
    "opencode/gpt-5.5:medium",
    "opencode/gpt-5.5:high",
    "opencode/kimi-k2.6",
    "openai/gpt-5.5:xhigh"
  ],
  "sessionTitleModel": "opencode/deepseek-v4-flash:nothink"
}
```

Pace remembers the last explicit variant used for each model in memory, so cycling away from a model and back restores that model's previous variant during the current run. Use Ctrl+T until the model label has no `:variant`, or run `/variant unset`, to return to the provider default without sending explicit variant options.

Pace uses `sessionTitleModel` to auto-name new sessions after the first user message. Choose a cheap, fast text model; for models with thinking variants, prefer a no-thinking variant such as `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash:nothink`. If title generation fails, Pace falls back to showing a preview of the first user message.

To display estimated costs in a specific currency, configure a USD conversion rate, display format, and how many fraction digits:

```json
{
  "cost": {
    "conversionRate": 10,
    "format": "{amount} kr",
    "fractionDigits": 1
  }
}
```

If `fractionDigits` is omitted, Pace uses dynamic precision similar to the default USD display.

While a tool call's arguments stream in from the model (for example the content of a large `write`), Pace appends the number of bytes received so far to the live tool title, e.g. `write: src/app.ts · 12600 B`. To turn it off:

```json
{
  "toolProgress": {
    "streamedBytes": false
  }
}
```

## Omarchy theme synchronization

Pace detects the active Omarchy theme background and uses its built-in dark or light theme. To update a running Pace session when Omarchy changes theme, install the included hook once from the Pace repository:

```sh
install -Dm755 scripts/omarchy-theme-set-pace-hook \
  "$HOME/.config/omarchy/hooks/theme-set.d/pace-theme"
```

The hook sends Pace `SIGUSR2` after Omarchy changes its theme. Pace then reads `~/.config/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml` and updates without a restart. The hook does not modify Pace configuration.

Pace follows the Omarchy dark or light mode. It does not copy individual Omarchy accent colors. A manual `/theme dark` or `/theme light` selection remains active until the next Omarchy theme change.

## Subagents

Subagents are specialized helpers that run in their own isolated context window. The main agent delegates tasks to them with the `agent` tool. Each subagent returns only its final result, so exploration and tool noise stay out of the main conversation.

Pace ships with one built-in agent:

- `explore` — fast, read-only codebase exploration

Define your own agents as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

- Project: `.agents/agents/<name>.md`
- Global: `~/.agents/agents/<name>.md`

```markdown
---
name: reviewer
description: Reviews code changes for bugs, security issues, and missing tests
tools: read, bash
---
You are a code reviewer. Analyze the given changes and report:
- Bugs and edge cases
- Security concerns
- Missing tests

Do not modify any files.
```

Frontmatter fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Must match the file name |
| `description` | Tells the main agent when to delegate. Be specific about trigger conditions |
| `tools` | Comma-separated allowlist. Omit for all tools |
| `model` | Optional model id, e.g. `opencode/claude-haiku-4-5`. Defaults to the current model |
| `variant` | Optional variant id for the model, e.g. `low` (reasoning effort). Ignored if the model has no such variant |

Subagents cannot spawn subagents. Use `/agents` to list available agents.

## MCP servers

Configure external tool servers in `~/.config/pace/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "filesystem": {
    "type": "local",
    "command": ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "~"],
    "enabled": true
  },
  "remote-api": {
    "type": "remote",
    "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
    "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <token>" },
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

MCP tools show up as `mcp__<server>__<tool>` and the agent uses them automatically when relevant.

`mcp.json` is a stable, manually-authored config file — Pace never writes to it. To enable or disable servers at runtime, press **Ctrl+E** or run `/mcps` to open a picker with checkboxes (like the model picker): space toggles a server, and the change takes effect immediately (the server connects or disconnects and its tools appear or disappear). The enabled/disabled state is saved to `~/.config/pace/prefs.json` and wins over the `enabled` field in `mcp.json`.

## Project structure
